## About
This portfolio is the place where I record my Data Science projects. The key aspects of this is to motivate myself to do self-learning, keep track of my progress, learn from the past mistakes and schedule the future studies. I'm aiming to update this page regularly.  

## Projects
### Water Pipe Failure Web Application
- Challenge    
Create a web application that can be used for data visualisation and data analysis.    
- Description    
Study the past water pipe failure records occurred in Sydney region and create a Web Application so that the user can sign in and upload their own water pipe raw datasets. This dataset should be joined with the up-to-date weather dataset downloaded from BOM. Once the dataset is ready for the analysis, the user can choose factors and graph type for data visualisation, and result should be displayed on the web application.
