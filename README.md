## About
This portfolio is the place where I record my Data Science projects. The key aspects of this is to motivate myself to do self-learning, keep track of my progress, learn from the past mistakes and schedule the future studies. I'm aiming to update this page regularly.  

## Water Pipe Failure Incidents
- Challenge    
What causes the water pipe failures to occur in Sydney region?    
- Description    
Create a Web Application so that the user can sign in and upload their own water pipe raw dataset. This dataset should be joined with the up-to-date weather dataset downloaded from BOM. Once the dataset is ready for the analysis, the user can choose factors and graph type for data visualisation, and result should be displayed on the web application.
